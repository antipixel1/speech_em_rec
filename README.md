# Speech emotion recognition with deep convolutional neural networks
Complete code for a python speech emotion recognition model, using the RAVDESS dataset.  
Current CNN model provided by the article from D Issa, MF Demirci and A Yazici: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1746809420300501  
Todo: Standarizing feature dataframe creation method, for datasets other than RAVDESS
Todo: Incrementing the current precision for RAVDESS to 80-90%, if new literature has upgrades to accuracy using CNN's.
